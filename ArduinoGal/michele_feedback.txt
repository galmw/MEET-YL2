Awesome job in finishing the project! You should be proud that you were able to make this project work - and the videos / photos that I uploaded to your Github account (one of them was the one that you made with Roni, the other was the one on my phone) are definitely photos / videos you can use to show what project you made. The idea of using the tree definition of Morse code (and successfully executing it) is a really large accomplishment. What you did was actually implement (in CS terms) a “state machine” that keeps track of where in the tree your progress is, and updates the internal “state” accordingly. It is an advanced concept, and I am glad you were able to implement it without knowing too much of the theory. You should be proud of your accomplishment - great job!
